**Section 1.3 - New Functions from Old Functions**

The following videos are lecture videos covering the material from Section 1.3 in Stewart's Calculus 8th edition. Each major topic in the section is broken down into a short video. 

---

In the first video we investigate the horizontal and vertical translations of functions and the corresponding algebraic relationships related to these geometric translations.

In the next video we discuss the horizontal and vertical stretching of a function and the related algebra.

Finally, we discuss the ideas of algebraically combining functions to make new functions.
